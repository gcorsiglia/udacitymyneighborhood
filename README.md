# My Neighborhood App

For this project, I developed a single-page application using React featuring a map of my town, Port Townsend, WA. I added additional functionality, including: map markers to identify popular locations, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a list view to support simple browsing of all locations. This is the seventh and final project in the [Udacity Front-end Development Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. The app utilizes Google Maps JavaScript API to render the map, markers, and infowindows; FourSquare API for venue data; and Google Street View API for images.

## How to View the App
